1. No stubbs - which means you code will have no placeholder code, no fake code, no dummy code,no simplied,no simple,no mock,no in production, no hardcoded values, no simulate. The code must be production grade and as advanced and complete as technologically possible.
2. Code you write must be modular, which means in the future if we need to extended to add features, it must be easy to add without breaking existing functionality.
3. Even though we are testing this in a local system, this whole product must be deployable on the cloud as well. So whereever you are using localhost now, should be tackled in a way that we can deploy on client's on-prem infra or cloud server like AWS, GCP, AZure or any other cloud provider.
4. Before you start building any feature, you must ensure you 100% understand exsiting features so that you do not make errors in the new features.
5. After every feature is developed, you will ensure required variables are in .env.example, all tables required for that features are updated at the very end of the schema.sql file.
6. After every feature is developed, you will 100% ensure that there is way to test that feature via a proper UI component.
7. The UI component must be professional and pleasing. UI/UX are of top priority.
8. Docker must have automatic port conflicts resolution so that development does not stop.
9. Absolutely all userguides must be in a webform, no .md files. You will create these user guides after every feature development.
10. This app will have an .env variable REQUIRE_AUTH which will have true or false,default false. If only true will the login process kick in, if REQUIRE_AUTH=false, no login/signup will be required for the app.
11. After every feature implementation, you will update teh action_list.md. Once you create it, you will not change or remove or delete the items in action_list.md without my explicit permission, This action_list.md will have ALL the items required to finish the techspec.md items.
12. After every feature development, you will perform automated testing of the UI and every code to ensure they are functional before moving on to the next feature item.
13. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE WILL YOU CREATE A MAKE SHIFT OR WORKAROUND OR SIMPLIED VERSION OF ANY CODE JUST TO PASS TESTS OR MAKE THINGS WORK. THINGS MUST BE PRODUCTION GRADE.
14. YOU WILL NOT PROVIDE LONG SUMMARIES AFTER EACH TASK, TASK/PHASE COMPLETION SUMMARIES MUST BE SHORT AND CRISP.
15. YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY NO PROCEED TO SUBSEQUENT PHASES UNLESS ALL ISSUES IN CURRENT PHASE ARE COMPLETED NO MATTER NOW SMALL OR NON-CRITICAL THEY ARE.
16. Every code must have comments about what the code is for and comments acorss the code which will enable the otherdevelopers to understand what the code is for.
17. When you test this, you will use docker services and do not use VENV.
18. Please do not name anything with phase references like "Phase1_api.py" or UI names which includes the word "Phase". Use proper feature names instead.
19. Do not use "Task1" or "Task2" or task as names in code or UI. It should have the actual feature name.
20.After completing each task you must check if the files you created as part of the said task meet @rule.mdc
