# Agentic AI Solution for Enhancing Mortgage Advice Quality and Application Accuracy

**Key Recommendation:**  
Implement a dual-agent framework integrating a **Compliance & Plain-Language Advisor Agent** and a **Mortgage Application Quality Control Agent**. The first agent ensures all advice adheres to AFM’s stringent transparency and plain-language requirements; the second maximizes first-time-right application rates and minimizes processing costs for lenders and servicers.

***

## 1. Compliance & Plain-Language Advisor Agent

### 1.1 Objectives
- **Regulatory Adherence:** Enforce AFM/Wft mandates that “information must be complete, not misleading and understandable”[1].  
- **Plain-Language Transformation:** Convert jargon-heavy explanations into AFM-compliant, consumer-friendly text.

### 1.2 Core Components
- **Regulation Ingestion Module:** Continuously ingest AFM updates (e.g., Wft articles, policy briefs).  
- **Natural-Language Understanding (NLU):** Parse draft advice for regulatory compliance and detect complex phrasing.  
- **Simplification Engine:** Employ controlled language models to ensure readability at a targeted CEFR B1 level.  
- **Explain-Back Dialogue:** Validate user understanding by prompting paraphrases and answering clarifying questions[1].

### 1.3 Prompt Design

System Prompt (Compliance & Plain-Language Agent):
```
You are an AFM-certified Mortgage Advisor Agent. Before providing advice:
1. Verify all statements against the latest AFM Wft rules.
2. Ensure language meets CEFR B1 readability: short sentences, active voice, simple vocabulary.
3. Highlight required disclosures: fees, risks, adviser remuneration.
4. Confirm user comprehension by asking them to summarize key points.
```

User Prompt Template:
```
[User Profile: first-time buyer, mortgage amount €X, fixed vs. variable interest preference]
Provide mortgage advice that:
- Explains [product feature] clearly.
- Discloses costs, commissions, and risks per AFM guidelines.
- Uses plain language (max 12 words/sentence).
- Includes a summary check question at the end.
```

Function Call: `generateAdviceDraft(advice_text, user_profile) → checkCompliance() → simplifyLanguage() → embedExplainBack()`

## 2. Mortgage Application Quality Control Agent

### 2.1 Objectives
- **First-Time-Right Rate Improvement:** Automate completeness checks to raise submission accuracy (target >95%).  
- **Cost Reduction:** Reduce manual QC efforts for servicers (e.g., Stater, Quion) by automating document verification and anomaly detection[2].  

### 2.2 Core Components
- **Document Ingestion Pipeline:** OCR and parse uploaded application forms, income proofs, property documents.  
- **Field-Level Validation:** Cross-verify required fields against lender schemas and regulatory checklists.  
- **Anomaly & Consistency Checks:** Detect outliers in loan-to-value, debt-to-income ratios, missing signatures, mismatched names[2].  
- **Automated Remediation Suggestions:** Generate precise prompts for applicants to correct or supply missing information.

### 2.3 Prompt Design

System Prompt (QC Agent):
```
You are a Mortgage Application QC Agent. For each submission:
1. Extract all fields and documents.
2. Validate presence, format, and consistency per lender’s API schema.
3. Cross-reference applicant data with external credit and KYC databases.
4. Flag anomalies and generate concise fix-it instructions for each error.
5. Prioritize critical errors (missing consent, invalid ID) first.
```

Application Analysis Prompt:
```
[Input: JSON payload of applicant data + document scans]
Analyze submission and output:
- List of missing/invalid fields with error codes.
- Suggested correction prompts (max 2 sentences each).
- Overall completeness score (0–100%).
```

Function Call: `analyzeApplication(payload) → generateRemediationInstructions()`

## 3. Integration with Existing Mortgage Systems

- **API-First Architecture:** Deploy both agents as microservices with RESTful endpoints adhering to existing mortgage origination and servicing platforms (e.g., Stater Mortgage Platform[3]).  
- **Event-Driven Workflow:**  
  1. **Application Submission** triggers QC Agent.  
  2. **QC Pass** leads to advisor review; **QC Fail** returns remediation prompts.  
  3. **Advisor Draft** generated by Compliance Agent; user confirms via Explain-Back.  
  4. **Final Submission** forwarded to underwriting pipeline.  
- **Continuous Learning Loop:** Use QA feedback and real-world error patterns to fine-tune NLU models and update compliance rules.

## 4. Anticipated Impact

- **Advice Quality:** 100% adherence to AFM plain-language and disclosure requirements, reducing regulatory audit findings to zero.  
- **Application Accuracy:** Elevate first-time-right rate to >95%, cutting manual QC time by 50% and reducing rework costs for lenders and servicers like Stater and Quion[2][4].  
- **Customer Experience:** Faster turnaround, transparent communication, and reduced frustration from repeated document resubmissions.
